# GitHub Migration Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Convert your 3-4 separate GitHub repositories into a single monorepo while keeping all services independent.

## 📋 Current State
You currently have separate repositories for:
- `MarketPulse-market-data` (market data service)
- `MarketPulse-processor` (processor service) 
- `MarketPulse-ui-desk` (UI service)
- `MarketPulse-config` (infrastructure config)

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `MarketPulse`
2. Make it public or private as per your preference
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### Step 2: Initialize Local Repository
```bash
# In your current directory (D:\TradingRepos)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Consolidate MarketPulse microservices into monorepo"
```

### Step 3: Connect to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MarketPulse.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Archive Old Repositories (Optional)
After confirming everything works:
1. Go to each old repository on GitHub
2. Go to Settings → General → Danger Zone
3. Click "Archive this repository"
4. This keeps the history but marks them as read-only

## 📁 Repository Structure

Your new monorepo will have this structure:
```
MarketPulse/
├── README.md                 # Main project documentation
├── DEVELOPMENT.md            # Development guide
├── .gitignore               # Git ignore rules
├── start-services.ps1       # Windows startup script
├── start-services.sh        # Linux/Mac startup script
├── create cluster.txt       # Cluster setup
├── ingress.yaml             # Kubernetes ingress
├── kafka-values.yaml        # Kafka configuration
├── MarketPulse-market-data/ # Market data microservice
├── MarketPulse-processor/   # Processor microservice
├── MarketPulse-ui-desk/     # UI desk microservice
└── MarketPulse-config/      # Infrastructure configuration
```

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

### For Developers
- **Single Repository**: No need to navigate between multiple repos
- **Easy Setup**: One clone gets everything
- **Consistent Environment**: All services in one place
- **Better Documentation**: Centralized README and guides

### For Users
- **Clear Overview**: See all services at once
- **Easy Installation**: Single repository to clone
- **Better Understanding**: Understand the full system architecture

### For Maintenance
- **Unified Issues**: All issues in one place
- **Coordinated Releases**: Easier to manage versions
- **Shared Documentation**: No duplication across repos

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Before (Multiple Repos)
```bash
# Clone each repository separately
git clone https://github.com/user/MarketPulse-market-data.git
git clone https://github.com/user/MarketPulse-processor.git
git clone https://github.com/user/MarketPulse-ui-desk.git
git clone https://github.com/user/MarketPulse-config.git

# Work on each separately
cd MarketPulse-market-data
# make changes
git add . && git commit -m "changes"
git push

cd ../MarketPulse-processor
# make changes
git add . && git commit -m "changes"
git push
```

### After (Single Repo)
```bash
# Clone once
git clone https://github.com/user/MarketPulse.git

# Work on any service
cd MarketPulse/MarketPulse-market-data
# make changes
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Update market data service"
git push
```

## 🏷️ Tagging Strategy

For releases, you can tag the entire project:
```bash
# Tag a release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Or tag individual services:
```bash
# Tag specific service changes
git tag -a market-data-v1.2.0 -m "Market data service v1.2.0"
git push origin market-data-v1.2.0
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Considerations

### GitHub Actions
You can create workflows that:
- Build all services on push
- Run tests for all services
- Deploy individual services
- Create releases

### Example Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build and Test Services
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-market-data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Market Data Service
        run: |
          cd MarketPulse-market-data
          mvn clean package

  build-processor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Processor Service
        run: |
          cd MarketPulse-processor
          mvn clean package
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Service Independence**: Each service remains completely independent
2. **No Shared Dependencies**: No parent POM or shared libraries
3. **Individual Deployment**: Each service can still be deployed separately
4. **Version Management**: Each service maintains its own version in pom.xml

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues during migration:
1. Check that all files are committed
2. Verify the remote repository URL
3. Ensure you have proper permissions on GitHub
4. Test the startup scripts after migration

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
- ✅ All services are in one repository
- ✅ All services start correctly using the scripts
- ✅ Documentation is clear and helpful
- ✅ Development workflow is improved
- ✅ Users can easily understand and use the project
